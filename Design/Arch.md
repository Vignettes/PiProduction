Explanation:

The Frontend handles user interactions, song upload, progress display, and social sharing instructions.
The Backend orchestrates authentication, file handling, integration with external services, payment workflows, and analytics.
The External Services layer represents all third-party APIs used for audio analysis, AI processing, payment, and social sharing.
The Database stores persistent user data, song metadata, and payment records.
3. Data Flow Diagram

Key Steps:

User Sign-Up / Sign-In:
User registers or logs in via the frontend.
Authentication request is sent to the backend, which integrates with OAuth providers if needed.
Song Upload:
User uploads an audio file.
The file is stored temporarily and sent to the Audio Analysis API.
Audio Analysis & Learning Plan Generation:
The backend forwards the file to the Audio Analysis API.
The returned chord breakdown is passed to the AI module, which generates a segmented learning plan.
Results are stored in the database and presented to the user.
Payment Processing:
Once the learning plan is delivered, the user is prompted for an initial 50% payment via the Payment Gateway.
Payment status is recorded in the database.
Social Proof Submission & Final Payment:
The user follows the provided instructions to share a video on social media.
The social proof (a link or upload) is submitted to the backend.
Verification (manual or automated) occurs; if verified within one month, the final 50% is waived, otherwise charged.
The database records final payment status.

6. Sequence Diagrams for Key Use Cases

6.1 Song Upload & Analysis Sequence
User uploads song via UI → File Handling Service stores file.
File Handling Service sends file to Audio Analysis Module.
Audio Analysis Module calls External Audio Analysis API.
API returns chord breakdown → Plan Generation Module processes data.
Learning plan is generated and stored in Database.
Results are sent back to Frontend and displayed to the user.
6.2 Payment and Social Proof Sequence
Learning Plan Delivery:
UI prompts user for 50% upfront payment.
User completes payment:
Payment Workflow Manager processes payment via Payment Gateway.
Status stored in PaymentTransaction.
Social Proof Submission:
User submits social proof (video link) → Social Proof Verification Module.
Verification occurs (manual/automated) → updates SocialProof record.
Conditional Payment:
If verification is successful within one month, the final 50% is waived.
Otherwise, Payment Workflow Manager charges the remaining amount.
7. Deployment Architecture

Hosting & CI/CD:

Frontend Deployment:
Hosted on platforms like Vercel or Netlify (free tier options), ensuring a fast, globally distributed CDN.
Backend Deployment:
Deployed on a platform such as Heroku (free tier) or a similar cloud service.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline set up using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
Database:
Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB Atlas (free tier) for a cost-effective, scalable solution.
Monitoring & Logging:
Use free/open-source tools (e.g., LogRocket for frontend error tracking, or Heroku’s logging add-ons) to monitor performance and errors.
8. Security & Operational Considerations

Authentication & Data Security:
Utilize HTTPS, secure storage for sensitive data, and follow best practices for OAuth integration.
Rate Limiting & API Quotas:
Implement rate limiting to handle free API quotas and prevent abuse.
Scalability:
Design backend services to be stateless where possible, using cloud storage and containerization (if needed) for horizontal scalability.
User Data Privacy:
Ensure compliance with privacy laws by encrypting user data and secure handling of payment information.
