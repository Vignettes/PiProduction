## Notes

### Priority Guidelines
1. Focus on core functionality first (auth, file upload, analysis)
2. Implement payment system early to enable revenue
3. Add social features after core experience is solid
4. Polish and optimize based on user feedback

### Technical Considerations
- Use free tier services where possible
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Focus on mobile-first development
- Maintain clear API documentation
- Follow security best practices

### Success Metrics
- User registration and retention rates
- Song analysis accuracy
- Payment completion rate
- Social proof submission rate
- User learning progress
- System performance metrics

### Risk Mitigation
- Have backup APIs identified for core services
- Implement proper data backup systems
- Create fallback UI states for all async operations
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Regular security audits

## Current Progress Summary
1. Backend infrastructure is set up and running
2. Database is configured with user authentication schema
3. Authentication system is implemented (local + OAuth)
4. Frontend base is set up with Next.js and Tailwind
5. Login/Signup pages are implemented
6. Basic routing and protected routes are in place
7. User profile and dashboard features are in progress

## Next Steps
1. Complete user profile implementation
2. Begin file upload system setup
3. Research and select audio analysis API
4. Start designing learning plan algorithm

### Risk Mitigation
- Have backup APIs identified for core services
- Implement proper data backup systems
- Create fallback UI states for all async operations
- Monitor API usage and costs
