Product Requirement Document (PRD)

1. Product Overview

Name: [Working Title: “ChordBreak”]

Description:
ChordBreak is a playful, modern web application designed to help users learn a song by automatically analyzing an uploaded audio file. The AI agent generates a detailed chord breakdown and a segmented learning plan. The payment model is innovative: users pay 50% upfront upon receiving the plan; if they share a social video proof of playing the song, the remaining 50% is waived; if they do not prove mastery within a month, the full fee applies. The application uses cost-effective, preferably free APIs to keep operational costs low while delivering an engaging, fun user experience.

Target Audience:

Aspiring musicians and hobbyists
Social media enthusiasts who enjoy sharing their learning progress
Users looking for an interactive and affordable way to learn songs
2. Goals and Objectives

Ease of Use: Offer a simple, intuitive interface where users can quickly upload a song and receive a chord breakdown and segmented learning plan.
Cost Efficiency: Utilize free or low-cost APIs and open-source libraries to minimize expenses.
Engagement: Encourage users to learn and share their progress on social media, leveraging community and gamification.
Modern Aesthetics: Maintain a minimalist, energetic, and creative design that reinforces the brand’s fun personality.
Security & Accessibility: Ensure secure user sign-in and smooth, cross-platform accessibility.
3. User Stories

As a new user, I want to create an account and sign in so that I can securely access my learning plans.
As a user, I want to upload a song (audio file) easily so that I can get an instant chord analysis.
As a user, I want the system to generate a detailed chord breakdown and a step-by-step learning plan segmented into parts, making it easier for me to master the song.
As a user, I want to see clear instructions on how to share my progress on social media to potentially waive the remaining fee.
As a user, I want the payment process to be straightforward with transparent conditions (50% upfront; 50% conditional on social proof or failure to prove learning).
As a returning user, I want to access my past song analysis and learning plans from my dashboard.
4. Functional Requirements

4.1 User Authentication and Profile Management
Sign-Up/Sign-In: Integration with common authentication methods (email/password, OAuth using free providers like Google or GitHub).
Profile Dashboard: Display user history (uploaded songs, learning plans, payment status).
4.2 Song Upload and Analysis
File Upload: Allow users to upload standard audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV).
AI Processing:
Use a free or low-cost audio analysis API to extract chords and musical structure.
Integrate with an AI service (e.g., a free tier from an AI provider or an open-source solution) to generate a segmented learning plan.
4.3 Learning Plan Generation
Chord Breakdown: Display chords visually with timing/segment indications.
Segmented Plan: Break down the song into learning segments (e.g., introduction, verse, chorus, bridge) with tips for practice.
Progress Tracking: Allow users to mark segments as completed.
4.4 Payment and Incentive Workflow
Initial Payment: Process an upfront payment of 50% when the plan is delivered.
Conditional Waiver:
Provide clear instructions for users to share a social video of them playing the song.
Implement a mechanism for users to submit proof (upload link or social media URL) within one month.
If proof is submitted and verified, waive the remaining 50%; otherwise, charge the full amount.
Payment Integration: Use a cost-effective payment gateway (e.g., Stripe with a free tier for basic transactions).
4.5 Social Sharing Integration
Social Media API: Integrate with major platforms (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) using available free APIs or share links.
Verification: Manual or automated check to validate the social share submission (this could be a simple review process initially).
